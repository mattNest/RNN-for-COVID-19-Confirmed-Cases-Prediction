# Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-COVID-19-Worldwide-Confirmed-Cases-Prediction

NCTU ECM Deep Learning Course Homework 2-1

In this problem, we are given a csv file that contains the number of confirmed cases with
COVID-19 in a period of time in different countries. We are required to implement a recurrent
neural network to classify whether the number of confirmed cases would increase or decrease in the next day. 

<br> Below is the diagram of how we preprocessed our data:
