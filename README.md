# Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-COVID-19-Worldwide-Confirmed-Cases-Prediction

NCTU ECM Deep Learning Course Homework 2-1

In this problem, we are given a csv file that contains the number of confirmed people with
COVID-19 in a period of time in different countries. We are required to implement a recurrent
neural network to classify if the number of confirmed people will increase in the next day. The
following figure shows some samples in the dataset.
